The <b> Web application project</b>, is an adapted version of the project lab done by the lecturer during the course and was created to gather information of a customer; taking in consideration names, surname and Price. The database can be used to adapt other business according to the needs.

It was added an auto incremental option in the database to make sure each customer have one ID and to control the information added and removed.  You can see the command to create the database [here](https://github.com/Katylub/Data-Representation-Project/blob/main/create_database.py)  

In this project we ignore virtual environment and the data base configuration.

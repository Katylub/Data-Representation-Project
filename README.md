# Data-Representation-Project 2020


# About this repository:

This repository contains the solutions for the Data Representation Project at GMIT.

The <b> Web application project</b>, is an adapted version of the project lab done by the lecturer during the course and was created to gather information of a customer; taking in consideration names, surname and Price. The database can be used to adapt other business according to the needs.

In summary you will see:
	• A basic Flask server that has a 
	• REST API, (to perform CRUD operations)
	• One database table and
	• Accompanying web interface (HTTP: methods and status code and JSON: JavaScript Object Notation ), using AJAX calls (with JQuery), to perform these CRUD operations

SQL Database
It was added an auto incremental option in the database to make sure each customer have one ID and to control the information added and removed.  You can see the command to create the database [here] (https://github.com/Katylub/Data-Representation-Project/blob/main/create_database.py)  

In this project we ignore virtual environment and the data base configuration.
